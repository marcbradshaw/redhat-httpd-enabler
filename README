RedHat httpd enabler
====================

Debian style control for a RedHat apache.

A while back I needed to be able to use debian style apache control on a redhat
based system, so the relevant helper scripts were extracted from debian and
packaged up with rpm.

Framework for the debian style, provides
sites-available sites-enabled mods-available mods-enabled
and associated util scripts.
